# React-Spotify-Web-Authentication

A bare bones Spotify login in React.

```
npm install

npm start
```
-------------

Visit http:localhost:3000 and click Login To Spotify.

After logging in you with Spotify are redirected back to the app, and your login status is displayed on screen.

The Spotify Access Token is stored in Local Storage, meaning your login status is maintained after reloading the app.

The Access Token lasts 1 hour, after which you will need to re-login
